 ## Playground is a super lightweight bot for starting voice channel activities.

# How do I use the bot?
The bot only has one feature and it's to start voice channel activities.
To not make things hard for the user the bot uses `/` commands which can easialy be used inside discord.
The command is:
`/activity <voice channel> <type of activity>`
The bot will send the message privatly in the chat (ephemeral) and will have 2 buttons. One is for joining the activity and the second button is for inviting the bot to a server.


<!-- ### How can I create my own bot using this template

2. download all the needed npm modules
3. add a `.env` file and inside of it write
```js
DISCORD_TOKEN=your discord token
```
4. host the bot in any server you want -->
